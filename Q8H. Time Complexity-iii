What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?

for( i=0;i<n ;i++){
for(j=i-1;j>=0;j++){
ans += i+j;
}
}


Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(n)
B) O(n^2)
C) Code will run indefinitely
D) O(1)
E) None of the above

Ans:C) Code will run indefinitely.
Explaination : Since the end of the loop is set 0 and its start is i-1 and variable j is increased rather than decreasing , j will always be greater or equal to 0
