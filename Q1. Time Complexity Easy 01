What is the Time Complexity of following snippet ?

int count=0;
while(N>0){
count++;
N/=3;
}

Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(N)
B) O(N*N)
C) O(Nlog(N))
D) O(log(N)) {Base 3}
E) O(log(N)) {Base 2}

Ans:O(log(N)) {Base 3}

Explaination: We have to find k such that,
N/(3^k) = 0
We will approx it to, N/(3^k) = 1
Or, N = 3^k
Taking log we will get k=logN where base is 3.
