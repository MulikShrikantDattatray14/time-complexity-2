What is the Time Complexity of following snippet ?


for(i=0;i<n ;i++){
for(j=0;j<n;j++){
break;
}
}


Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(N*N)
B) O(N*log(N))
C) O(N)
D) O(log(N))
E) None of the above

Ans:O(N).

Explaination: Here for every i the inner loop will run for only interation. So the complexity is the number of times outer loop will run.
That is N so complexity is O(N).
