What will be the time complexity of the above function where n is a positive integer?


while(n>0){
n++;
n-=2;
}

Choose the correct answer from below:
A) Infinite loop
B) O(n)
C) O(nlogn)
D) O(logn)
E) None of the above

Ans: B) O(n)

Explaination : Overall, in each iteration, the value of n decreases by 1. So, there would be a total of n operations.
Hence, the time complexity is O(n).
