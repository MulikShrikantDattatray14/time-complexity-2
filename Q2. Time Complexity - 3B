What will be the Time Complexity of the given code?

int i=1;
while(i< n ){
int x=i;
while(x--  > 0){
//0(1) operations.
}
i++;
}



Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(nlogn)
B) O(n)
C) O(n sqrt(n))
D) O(n^2)
E) None of the above


Ans: D) O(n^2)

Explaination: The total number of operations taking place is the sum of first n natural numbers, which is equal to n * (n + 1) / 2.
Therefore, the time complexity is O(n2).
