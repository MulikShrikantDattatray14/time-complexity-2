What is the time complexity of the following code snippet?


int sum=0;
for(int i=0;i<=N;i++){
for(int j=i;j<=N && j>i ; j++){
sum+=i;
}
}

Choose the correct answer from below:
A) O(N^2)
B) O(N)
C) O(NlogN)
D) None of these

Ans: B) O(N)
Explaination : Since the inner loop condition is the j should be greater than i and as j is initialised with i , the inner loop will stop then and there.
Hence O(N) time complexity
